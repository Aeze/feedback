To Deploy
===

Prerequisites: [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


After you deploy you'll have to migrate the database:

`heroku run -a app_name rake db:migrate`

And then your should be up and running on Heroku. :)


To Use
===
When you first go to your application's URL you'll be prompted to create an administrator account. You should do this immediately because there is only one administrator allowed at one time. 

At http://yourappurl.com/settings you can modify global settings for the application.

At http://yourappurl.com/admin you can find a dashboard where you can modify users, issues, and other aspects of the site. 

At http://yourappurl.com/posts you can create news posts for version updates, general announcements, etc.
